						<p class="content">Condoms are the only form of protection that can both help to stop the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as HIV and prevent pregnancy.</p><strong>Wearing a condom has double advantage</strong><br>Using a condom while having sex protects you from becoming infected with sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV. At the same time it also prevents unwanted pregnancy.<br><strong>Selecting the right condom</strong><br>There are several types of condoms available in the market that you can choose from<br>Most condoms are made of either latex or polyurethane. Latex condoms are more effective in terms of providing protection as chances of tear or leak are less. However, latex condoms will easily tear if an oil-based lubricant is used. Some people may also be allergic to latex.<br>Polyurethane condoms are thinner, which may give some users better sensation and pleasure.<br>Some condoms contain a spermicidal chemical called Nonoxynol 9. Till recently it was thought that adding it would provide better protection against pregnancy and the transmission of HIV and other STDs, but recent studies have shown no added advantage.<br>Size of the condom should generally not be a concern as most condoms fit most men. The definition of regular, large, and extra-large is not consistent across brands. It may be a good idea to try a few products to figure out what works the best for you. The basic idea is that it should not be so tight that it pinches or so loose that it slips off.<br><strong>How to use a condom?</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Check the expiry date on the condom packet. Do not use the condom if the expiry date has passed.</li>
							<li>Tear open the condom package carefully. Do not use scissors or your teeth to open the package as you may damage the condom in the process.</li>
							<li>Remove the condom from the package, but do not unroll it right away. It is tough to put on an unrolled condom and it also makes it more likely to tear.</li>
							<li>See if the condom has a reservoir tip. If it does not, pinch the tip of the condom to leave a half inch space for semen to collect.</li>
							<li>Now place the rolled condom over the tip of the erect penis. Uncircumsied men should pull back the foreskin before rolling down the condom.</li>
							<li>Gently unroll the condom over the penis with the other hand all the way down to the base. Smooth out air bubbles as they can cause the condom to break.</li>
							<li>You may apply some water-based lubricants such as KY-Jellly or Durex Play on the outer surface of the condom for extra lubrication. This is helpful if you or your partner are having intercourse for the first time. Do not use oil-based lubricants such as vaseline, cold creams and lotions because these can cause the condom to tear</li>
						</ul><strong>Proper Usage Entails</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Not putting the condom on too tight at the end, and leaving about 1.5 cm (3/4 inch) room at the tip for ejaculation. Putting the condom on too snug can and often does lead to failure.</li>
							<li>Wearing a condom too loose can defeat the barrier.</li>
							<li>Avoiding condoms made of substances other than latex or polyurethane, as they don’t protect against HIV.</li>
							<li>Avoiding the use of oil based lubricants (or anything with oil in it) with latex condoms, as oil can eat holes into them.</li>
							<li>Using flavored condoms for oral sex only, as the sugar in the flavoring can lead to yeast infections if used to penetrate.</li>
							<li>Withdrawing the penis soon after ejaculation while the condom is still firmly in place and removing the condom only when you have completely withdrawn from your partner.</li>
							<li>Using a new condom every time you have sexual intercourse. Never use the same condom twice, whether or not you have ejaculated into it.</li>
						</ul>

						<p class="content">Many men and women feel anxious about having sex during periods because we have been culturally conditioned to believe that menstruation is something dirty. There are also many misconceptions about the medical aspects of sex during periods. Medically, it is normal to have sex during periods. The safe sex practices required to avoid pregnancy and STDs when a woman is not menstruating should also be used during periods.</p>
						<p class="content">1. Can sex during periods result in pregnancy?Chances of pregnancy during periods are minimal. However, if you strictly want to avoid pregnancy it is advisable to use an adequate birth-control method each time you have intercourse, including during periods. Though the chances of pregnancy during periods are very low, they are not entirely absent because the sperm can survive in the body for a few days and there is a small chance that an early ovulation will cause pregnancy.2. Will contact with menstrual blood cause sexually-transmitted diseases (STD)?Menstrual blood is nothing but normal human blood mixed with tissues lining the uterus. Contact with menstrual blood is not harmful in any way. If your partner has a STD, you have a high chance of contracting it and you should be using a condom during intercourse, both during periods and otherwise.3. Does sex during periods cause HIV infection?Sex during periods cannot cause HIV infection unless one of the partners is HIV infected. Unprotected intercourse with an HIV infected partner can cause HIV infection, regardless of periods. The only connection between HIV and sex during periods is that the chances of HIV transmission from an HIV infected person to his/ her partner are higher if they have sex during periods. If you have the slightest concern about HIV infection, the thumb rule is to use a condom regardless of periods.4. Will contact with menstrual blood harm the penis?No, menstrual blood will not harm the penis in any way. The worries and concerns about menstrual blood stem from the fact that we have been socially conditioned to see it as a dirty fluid. Scientifically, menstrual fluid is a mix of blood and tissues that line the uterus every month to prepare it for pregnancy. If pregnancy does not occur, the tissue is shed because it is no longer required.5. Can sex during periods injure the uterus?No, sex during periods cannot injure the uterus. There is a common perception that the mouth of the uterus opens up during periods and the penis can poke into it and hurt the uterus. This is not correct. Menstrual flood oozes out of a very small opening in the mouth of the uterus. The penis can never poke in through this opening.6. Is sex during periods a perversion?You would be happy to know that a large number of couples have sex during periods. From the medical standpoint, sex during periods is absolutely normal. So if you too indulge in it, there is absolutely no need to feel guilty or anxious.7. Will sex during periods stop bleeding?Some women do notice that their periods stop within a day or so of sexual intercourse. This does not mean that the menstrual blood has been pushed back into the uterus and is unable to flow out. It happens primarily because sexual intercourse causes uterine contractions that expel the menstrual fluids and tissue faster, thus causing the bleeding to stop sooner than usual.8. Will sex during periods relieve menstrual cramps?Yes, some women do experience a decrease in menstrual cramps if they have sexual intercourse. This can happen because of multiple factors. On one hand, orgasm causes the release of some chemicals in the body that have pain allaying properties. Some scientists also believe that this happens because excess cramp causing chemicals called prostaglandins get used up.9. Is it ok to have oral sex during periods?Yes, from the health perspective it is ok to have oral sex during periods. It is advisable to use a dental dam if you have oral sex with a menstruating female partner.10. Should I remove my tampon before having sex during periods?Yes, always remember to remove your tampon before having sex during periods. If you do not do this there is a chance that the tampon will get pushed up in your vagina and if it is left there for a prolonged period, it can cause infection</p>
