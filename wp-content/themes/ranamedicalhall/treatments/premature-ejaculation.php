									<p>A pen is mightier than the sword, But what-if it&#39;s spilling the ink!...&nbsp;
									</p>

									<p>A penis is no different If it spills untimely!&nbsp;</p>

									<p>Yes!, Premature <u><strong><a
													href="<?php echo get_permalink(get_page_by_title('Health Talks')) ?>/sex-is-thrilling/"><span
														style="color:#FF0000;">Climax kills the
														thrill</span></a></strong></u> in bed.</p>

									<h3>Ejaculation... Know the Process</h3>

									<p>During sexual arousal, men&#39;s <u><strong><a
													href="<?php echo get_permalink(get_page_by_title('Health Talks')) ?>/does-penis-size-matter-in-sex/"><span
														style="color:#FF0000;">Penis</span></a></strong></u> gets
										Erected and is ready for sexual intercourse. When he&#39;s at peak of
										<u><strong><a
													href="<?php echo get_permalink(get_page_by_title('Health Talks')) ?>/reignite-the-lost-passion-and-intimacy-in-your-love-life/"><span
														style="color:#FF0000;">sexual
														excitement</span></a></strong></u>, an <strong>Orgasm</strong>
										or climax happens and <strong>semen</strong> (also called ejaculate or cum)
										&nbsp;is ejaculated out from his penis. As soon as it ejaculates, Penis lose its
										Erection state and get back to its Normal, soft or flaccid state.&nbsp;Needless
										to say, Sexual Penetration is not possible in that condition.</p>

									<h3>Normal Ejaculation v/s Premature Ejaculation: Know it.</h3>

									<p><strong>Normal Ejaculation and Orgasm</strong><br />
										&nbsp;A man who&#39;s blessed with normal sexual health can easily penetrate her
										with his <strong>firm and hard Erected Penis</strong>. He is also capable
										to&nbsp;stroke her until he and his partner are sexually satisfied.&nbsp;</p>

									<p>When he attains a high excitement level, which is called <strong>Orgasm</strong>,
										he ejaculates. Here both the partners can reach Orgasm.</p>

									<p><strong>Premature Ejaculation (PE): Was it a Real Orgasm?</strong></p>

									<p>But a man with abnormal rapid ejaculation issues unintentionally ejaculates way
										before he and his partner wish. In fact, <strong>Erection vanishes</strong>
										leaving them unsatisfied.&nbsp;</p>

									<p>Here, ejaculation is happening, But that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s at his peak of
										sexual pleasure to obtain a real orgasm.<br />
										This is not the normal Ejaculation which happened as a result of his sexual
										fulfilment, But a <strong>premature orgasm</strong> happened because of his
										<strong>sexual disorders</strong>.</p>

									<p><strong>Premature Ejaculation (PE) - The immediate effect</strong><br />
										Can you imagine the distressed feel of a lady, &nbsp;who&#39;s the real victim
										of PE?<br />
										Indeed, the lady will be <u><strong><a
													href="<?php echo get_permalink(get_page_by_title('Health Talks')) ?>/sexual-frustration-suffering-in-silence/"><span
														style="color:#FF0000;">frustrated</span></a></strong></u> and
										upset as she cannot reach orgasm or sensual pleasure because of his early
										ejaculation issues.</p>

									<h3>Premature Ejaculation (PE) and Intimacy Issues.</h3>

									<p>We come across many PE cases daily, what&#39;s common in most cases is the
										relationship issues they&#39;re going through.</p>

									<p>During the initial days of early ejaculation issues, couples ignore their problem
										and move on.<br />
										When this happens regularly, sexual frustration builds up and it&#39;s no longer
										a matter to be ignored. Slowly relationship issues arose.</p>

									<p><strong>Sexual problems and related disorders should not be disregarded</strong>.
										It may seem simple at the start. But definitely <strong>get worse over
											time</strong>.</p>

									<h3>Do you have Premature Ejaculation (PE) Disorder- Know the Symptoms!</h3>

									<p>Untimely ejaculation can happen at any stage of sexual activity, it badly affects
										the sexual enjoyment of partners.&nbsp;Check whether you are prone to PE.</p>

												itself.</strong>&nbsp;</li>
										<li>Foreplay goes well, but succumb to <strong>Untimely ejaculation while trying
												to Get in</strong>.</li>
										<li>Entering is well and good but <strong>fails in stroking</strong> because as

										fails, These repeated failures create stress and anxiety. <strong>He loses his
											confidence and is incapable to satisfy her in bed.</strong></p>

									<p><strong>Let&#39;s hear how a lady tackled her husband&#39;s PE issues
											wisely.</strong></p>

									<h3><strong>Let The Excitement Continues&hellip;</strong></h3>

									<p>Irene: &ldquo;For the initial 2-3 years our life paddled in happiness...</p>

									<p>Then there started the problem.&hellip;.</p>

									<p>I felt he was showing some sort of inhibition in bed. Even if I took the
										advances, he always turned away from me. He never had the confidence to comply
										with my feelings.</p>

									<p>Initially, I was not pretty aware of the reason fully. On and on I tackled the
										cause, that he ends up reaching his peak way before I do.</p>

									<p>He loses all his energy, stamina and excitement at the very outset itself and I
										leave myself as an unsatisfied soul, full of frustration and depression.</p>

									<p>The same thing repeated many a time.</p>

									<p>I was compelled to ask him about consulting the best Premature Ejaculation
										treatment <strong><u><a
													href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/althaf-ibrahem-rana/"><span
														style="color:#FF0000;">doctor</span></a></u></strong><span
											style="color:#0000CD;">.</span> But to my deadly surprise, he was terribly
										disturbed hearing this, because he felt it makes his manliness put to test.</p>

									<p>Later on, he started avoiding me, which ended in ceasing his appearances in the
										bedroom. I was dejected and was not able to bear this torture and loneliness.
									</p>

									<p>Out of this mental tussle and trauma, I decided to part with him. But my love
										towards him still lingered. Madam, I don&rsquo;t want to lose him&rdquo;.</p>

									<p>Tears rollicked from her eyes.</p>

									<p>Madam: &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t get disheartened.</p>

									<p>It is a general trait of the spouses that they will discuss any sort of domestic
										matters, whether it is financial planning, children&lsquo;s education,
