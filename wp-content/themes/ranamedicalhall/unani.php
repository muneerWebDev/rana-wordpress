                            <p class="content">Unani is an antique demonstrable system of medicine practised for a period of more than 7000 years. This system traces back its origin in ancient Greece which in the Arabic language called &lsquo;Unan&rsquo; or&rsquo; Yunan&rsquo;. Aesculapius is credited as the originator of this system which is passed on to Buqrat, better known as Hippocrates (460 &ndash; 377 BC) who is the descendant of him and recognized as the &lsquo;Father of Unani medicine&rsquo;.</p>

                            <p class="content">A student of Unani can experience the status of it, if he observes the travelling of this cult system across the globe, spanning over different cultures, over different periods. Presumably, this system was developed in four time periods in four distinct geographical belts.<br />
                                1.Greek period<br />
                                2.Arab-Persian period<br />
                                3.Spanish period<br />
                                4.Indian period</p>

                            <p class="content">Based on the teachings of the Greek physicians Hippocrates and Galen, the hypothetical formulations of the Unani system is conceived and recorded by Ibn &ndash;e-Sina in his classical 11th-century work, The Canon of medicine&rsquo;.</p>

                            <p class="content">This Hellenistic system of medicine was highly influenced and gained tremendous momentum in the Arabian Peninsula. And it is from there Unani attained its present status, shape and size.</p>

                            <p class="content">The propagation of the divine healing of cupping therapy (Hijamath) by Islam revolutionized the unani system which from there transmitted to the nook and corner of the world. The arrival of this unflinching system through the Khyber Pass to India became easier due to the high patronage of the Delhi Sultanate.</p>

                <p class="content">In India, the Unani system attained a new turn with the vehement influence of the classic Indian system of medicine &ndash;The Ayurveda. Though Unani had a marked hypothetical resemblance with Ayurveda already, after its advent to India, it embraced the promulgators of Ayurveda, Sushruta&rsquo;s and Charaka&rsquo;s visionary medical fundamentals&hellip;</p>

                <p class="content">A basic Indian who was already transgressed in an Ayurveda healing method found it easy to switch over to Unani.</p>

                <p class="content">The basic tenet of Ayurveda itself being human body is a composition of pancha bhutas (prithvi-ap-thejo-vayu-akasham) has a marked similarity with its Unani counterpart which formulates as the human body is a compound of 4 elements earth, air, water and fire.</p>

                <h4 class="post-title">Basic Concepts Of Unani</h4>

                <p class="content">The entire concept of Unani system is based on four humor theory of Hippocrates-blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile. As per Unani, the human body is an amalgam of the following seven components:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Arkan (Elements)</li>
                    <li>Mizaj (Temperament)</li>

                <p class="content">A body can be said to be in &lsquo;health&rsquo;, when all the humors are in equilibrium and body functions normally. All the above-said factors thus are very important to determine the perfect health of a man. In unani, diagnosis of a disease is done by taking all these factors into account.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A one to one interaction with the client with leads to a detailed physiological investigation is done.</li>
                    <li>Physical examination including pulse (nabz), urine and stool analysis will be performed.</li>
                    <li>Along with this, the present age pathological examinations will be carried out, if needed, using the state of the art techniques.</li>
                </ul>
                For the diagnosis following factors are considered:

                <ul>
                    <li>Every person differs from another in his stuff and material. We preliminarily consider this feature into account.</li>
                    <li>A person is endowed with temperament, structure and strength. The second consideration is related to this.</li>
                    <li>The Third point we take up is outside factors that can affect a person.</li>
