<p>AYURVEDIC MEDICINE FOR PREMATURE EJACULATION</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Why Sexual Health is important?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lovemaking is the most powerful and beautiful way to express your love, Intimacy and Emotions to your partner. In fact, <strong><span class="has-inline-color has-very-dark-gray-color">Sexual Compatibility</span></strong> is an important factor for determining the sexual satisfaction of couples. However, the sexual&nbsp;beliefs, preferences, Turn-ons and OFFs, desires hot spots, interest, needs and indeed, everything differs from person to person. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-very-dark-gray-color">Sexual Happiness</span></strong> happens when you are comfortable in sharing your wishes and feelings with the partner and the partner acknowledge it completely. Don't forget to make sure that your partner is having the same comfortability with you as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-very-dark-gray-color">Sexual Health plays an important role in maintaining the Sexual satisfaction, Happiness and Compatibility among partners.</span></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keeping SEXUAL Health intact is important to keep your Sexual Life in pace. For instance, a man with early ejaculation issues struggles to make his partner sexually satisfied in bed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Premature Ejaculation: Symptoms, Causes, Treatment &amp; Prevention</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What is Premature Ejaculation (PE)? (PE is also known as early ejaculation, rapid ejaculation, rapid climax and premature climax)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Premature Ejaculation is a condition where a man is unable to hold off his ejaculation or climax that is happening at a very early stage of intercourse. Premature ejaculation Indeed upsets the rhythm of Sex. Ejaculation happens too quickly without control and consent of partners. When this becomes a persistent problem, obviously it will adversely affect the relationship between partners and the quality of a man's sex life.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Causes of Premature Ejaculation</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Psychological and physical conditions can be blamed here. Psychological impacts that affect ejaculation and sexual performance are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Performance Anxiety</li><li>Relationship problems</li><li>Over excitement</li><li>Guilty feelings</li><li>Depression</li><li>Stress</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Some physical conditions can also be the reason for PE, like</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Irregular hormone levels </li><li>Abnormal neurotransmitters levels</li><li>Prostate or urethral Inflammation or infections</li><li>Hereditary traits</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moreover, Erectile Dysfunction (ED) can be a reason too. A person with erectile Dysfunction tends to ejaculate soon because of his worry about losing an erection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When this becomes a habit, he will start to ejaculate soon. Actually here the sexual problem is.erectile dysfunction and not PE. By taking <a href="https://roymedicalhall.com/treatments/erectile-dysfunction.html"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Erectile Dysfunction curable and affordable</span></strong></a> treatment he can recover from his ED issues and PE as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Premature Ejaculation adversely affects the intimacy of partners, lower self-esteem and self-confidence of a person. Make sure to Fix these hurdles forever by taking Ayurvedic Medicines for Premature Ejaculation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Holistic Healing for Premature Ejaculation</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Premature Ejaculation is a sexual dysfunction in men caused by numerous Emotional impacts and physical factors.&nbsp;Obviously, the <span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color"><strong>Best Premature Ejaculation Treatment</strong></span> should be the one that diagnoses the real cause and treat psychological imbalances and physical issues effectively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<h5>Harmful Habits</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In spite of knowing the adverse side effects caused by smoking, alcoholism, drugs abuse and other such unhealthy practices in their life, people get addicted to it easily. These high-risk addictions are truly life-threatening and you are knowingly setting up yourself for many serious health issues. One such devastating effect of these unhealthy practices is Premature Ejaculation in men.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Similarly, these unhealthy practices very much influence the erection power (Erectile Dysfunction) of a person which in turn may create early Ejaculation issues. Save yourself from these harmful habits to Get back on track.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some changes are good. Unlearn some old behavioural patterns and embrace new techniques in bed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-very-dark-gray-color">Stress Management:</span></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sex with Stress is the biggest challenge ever, especially to a man with early ejaculation issues. A man who's facing psychological issues like stress, tension, depression, performance anxiety and other such mental pressures are more likely to suffer PE and other sexual disorders in his life. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Similarly, if a man has early ejaculation Issues, it will affect his self-esteem and confidence which in turn invokes stress and other psychological issues. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thus stress and PE are very much interrelated. <strong><span class="has-inline-color has-very-dark-gray-color">Stress management is the best prevention method for PE</span></strong>. Likewise, it helps in the treatment of PE as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-very-dark-gray-color">Talk to your partner</span></strong> about your mental state and tensions in Sex. She's the best person there to help you out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-very-dark-gray-color">Proper dietary habits</span></strong> is yet another vital factor that helps to keep stress at bay. Eat a balanced diet and get good sleep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->

		<Title>Size of Indian Male Organ</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What's the average size of Indian male organ?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Average Size of Indian Male Organ - PENIS SIZE - <strong>AN ALL-TIME 'HEAD-SCRATCHER' QUESTION... </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> 'Bigger, the best', is a common perception&nbsp;prevailing&nbsp;and unfortunately, this thought is stuck in their mind at a very early age itself. By watching pornography </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>or from <span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">Hyped Sexual Stories</span> or </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">teased or bullied by friends or partner</span> about their 'size' </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Or by </strong><span class="has-inline-color has-black-color"><strong>seeing some pictures or certain advertisement</strong>s</span> etc, this thoughts might have imprinted in the minds of people.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All these give a false notion about their size,&nbsp;and they're forced to believe that they are 'small-sized' and obviously it will make them mentally sick by draining all their confidence. They lose their self-worth and self-esteem. The over concern and tension about size can lead to anxiety and depression and ends up in total sexual failures.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First and foremost, Men link their manhood with their size, they have a misconception that they can make women happy only if they have a 'big size'. But what actually matters is not the size alone but the confidence about your stamina, capacity, quality erection, timing, consistency and overall performance as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Are you Confused about Penis Size?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, The size of the penis varies from person to person.&nbsp;Some&nbsp;big-sized, some normal and some are below average. For complete sexual satisfaction, the average size of Indian male organ or his 'erected penis size' should be&nbsp;at least&nbsp;4 inches.&nbsp;Most men, of all ages, always have a worry about their size.&nbsp;Even&nbsp;the 'normal-sized' men <strong><span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">have confusions and concerns</span></strong> about their size and think it as 'small'.&nbsp;Don't let that confusion grow, do a self-examination by measuring yours or can consult our sexologist for better understanding.</p>

<h2>Will the average size of Indian male organ 'shrink' by any chance?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>PENIS SIZE - Many reasons like ageing, overweight, &nbsp;side effects of some medications, lifestyle problems like smoking, drugs, over alcoholism, absence of physical activity can affect you. Also, Changes in <span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">testosterone can affect your erection power</span>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the Unani System of Medicine, Over masturbation in course of time causes damage to the penile nerves and can lead to shrinkage of the penis as well. This adversely affects the average size of Indian male organ. <a href="/health-talks/masturbation-in-men-and-side-effects/">masturbation side effects and treatment</a> helps you to save yourself from over addiction to masturbation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Obviously, Lack of quality erection means penis fails to get the 'original size', &nbsp;firmness and is incapable to sustain the erection for the play. Its quite obvious that erection issues are one of the main reasons that affect the penis, to shrink and make it look small. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Often erection issues misinterpret as penis shrinkage or size problems. If not diagnosed properly, it leads to many complications and consequences in your sexual capacity and performance. <a href="/treatments/erectile-dysfunction.html">Erectile Dysfunction curable and affordable treatment</a> can save you from erection related problems in your sexual life</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Normally, average size of Indian male organ is difficult to get back the original size and erection power naturally. BUT fortunately, with proper and timely medication reverses it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->

<!-- /wp:uagb/advanced-heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":18} -->
<p style="font-size:18px">According to The&nbsp;<strong>World Health Organization&nbsp;(WHO)</strong>, child abuse&nbsp;and&nbsp;child maltreatment&nbsp;is "all forms of physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect or negligent treatment or commercial or other exploitation, resulting in actual or potential harm to the child's health, survival, development or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust or power. It is distinguished into four types of child maltreatment:&nbsp;physical abuse;&nbsp;sexual abuse;&nbsp;emotional (or psychological) abuse; and&nbsp;neglect.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":17} -->
<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>Physical Abuse: </strong> Intentional use of physical force against the child that results in&nbsp;– or has a high likelihood of resulting in&nbsp;– harm for the child's health, survival, development or dignity. This includes hitting, beating, kicking, shaking, biting, strangling, scalding, burning, poisoning and suffocating. Much physical violence against children in the home is inflicted with the object of punishing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":18} -->
<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>Child Sexual Abuse (CSA)</strong> is a form of child abuse in which an adult or older adolescent abuses a child for sexual stimulation. Psychological maltreatment is "the most challenging and prevalent form of child abuse and neglect."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":18} -->
<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>Child Neglect</strong> is the failure of a parent or other person with responsibility for the child, to provide needed food, clothing, shelter, medical care, or supervision to the degree that the child's health, safety or well-being may be threatened with harm. Neglect is also a lack of attention from the people surrounding a child, and the non-provision of the relevant and adequate necessities for the child's survival, which would be a lack of attention, love, and nurturing.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":18} -->
<p style="font-size:18px">We hear lots of heart-wrenching News about child abuse in daily and social media. It's happening around the globe, in spite of caste, creed, race, religion, language and GENDER... </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":17} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">Child abuse is the worst thing that is happening in our universe. Whenever we hear a piece of news, its hard to believe that this still exists in this empowered, evolved world, but the truth is that its happening everywhere in rich and poor families, among educated and uneducated people, all cultures, schools, workplaces and even in homes.  It's our duty to demolish this cruelty from our society.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4> WHAT CAN DO AGAINST CHILD ABUSE FROM OUR END? </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Safety begins at home.</strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"normal"} -->
<p class="has-normal-font-size">Domestic violence against children is becoming more and more alarming.parents and families should take care to exclude children from the same. Arguments, fight and abuse between parents and family members will affect them mentally and many times they're even prone to physical abuse inside their families itself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":18} -->
<p style="font-size:18px">Sexual abuse is a  major problem that affects our children. The saddest part in child sexual abuse is that a good percentage of sexual assault they face is from close family members or family friends, and sometimes children did not realize that they're being abused.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":18} -->
<p style="font-size:18px">We, parents, teachers or family members should make them aware of that. Teach them the difference between good touch and bad touch. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":18} -->
<p style="font-size:18px">Make them aware of the private parts of the body and the courage to say no to assaulters. Speak to them, be mentally connected, so that they'll open up when they face any such issues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":18} -->
<p style="font-size:18px">Proper parenting is needed, many social organization is guiding parents by conducting seminars, counselling and other methods to make them aware.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":18} -->
<p style="font-size:18px">School or educational institutions can help a lot in demolishing this from our society. Awareness about sexual abuse or any other abuse should be done at schools. <a href="http://www.roymedicalhall.com">Counselling</a> can help a lot to understand the chaos of children.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":18} -->
<p style="font-size:18px">The after-effects of child abuse are short term and long-term. It causes depression, anxiety, stress, post-traumatic stress disorder, physical traumas, affects self-esteem, learning and <a href="https://roymedicalhall.com/consultation-form.html">behavioural disorder</a>, high chance of getting assaulted again after-effects are endless…. Yes!! Some injuries never heal…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>The support we give to the victims is very important.</strong></p>

<h4> <strong>Masturbation and Negative affectivity!!!..</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Masturbation and Side effects - Just to get quick sexual relief, many men depend on masturbation and they tend to climax very quickly, to get relieved. When this 'quick climax' tendency becomes a habit, it may start reflecting in their sexual life, with their partner also.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<h4>Orgasm!!… Self-play v/s Real play</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reaching Orgasm through masturbation and intercourse is very different. With a solo play, you can't reach a complete sexual satisfaction and the very next hour or the day you will get the urge for another. In the case of lovemaking, you are getting a full feel by doing foreplay,  real play and post play. It increases the intimacy between you two, provides complete sexual satisfaction to both mind and body, helps in good sleep, good for overall health, relieves stress and much more. <strong>Next time, when you need a sexual joy, why don't lovemaking, rather than a solo play?</strong></p>

		<Title>The path of intimacy... Are you there??</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h1> THE PATH OF INTIMACY... ARE YOU THERE??  </h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Path of Intimacy - In fact, Healthy Satisfied Physical relationship between partners strengthens the love, companionship and intimacy of that relationship even more. But in many cases, not to mention, unsatisfied physical relationship affects the affection, intimacy and closeness of partners. If unattended and ignored, of course, small problems between the partners grow beyond repair. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>  Intimacy is the key to a successful marital life and a happy physical life makes it beautiful and joyful. But is your intimacy growing or dying??..  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[1368]} -->
<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://ranamedicalhall.com/health-talks/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/path-of-intimacy-1024x702.jpg" alt="" data-id="1368" data-full-url="https://ranamedicalhall.com/health-talks/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/path-of-intimacy.jpg" data-link="https://ranamedicalhall.com/health-talks/?attachment_id=1368" class="wp-image-1368"/></figure></li></ul></figure>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2> What is the reason for this? (Path of Intimacy)</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Lack of communication between the partners is the main reason here. Partners communicate about all subjects under the sky except physical life. The most important fertilizer of their relationship is unfortunately ignored here. Communication is the key..talk, talk and talk...let that be your mantra...  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5> What to blame? </h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>  'Lack of understanding' is to blame. Try to understand the need of your partner, what makes them happy and aroused, understanding your partner is your right and duty..it brings beauty to your life. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>  Is there any way out? </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>  Your Way out from this is by building companionship with your partner. Love your partner with all your heart, then they will value your company above all the other things in this world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4> How can one avoid such situations? </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>  Compatibility of partners helps to avoid this. Include more and more foreplays, do what they like selflessly, ask about their likings, discuss about what and how you like, make it lively and interesting, try new things, be innovative and creative in sex and yes!!.. which is the thumb rule. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What can be the ultimate solution? </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>  Lack of Intimacy destructs the relationship... Sometimes beyond recall !!..  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Call in for a meet up with our <a href="https://roymedicalhall.com/consultation-form.html">sexologist </a>to find ways to rebuild your intimacy... Because some things in life cannot be postponed!!!.. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3> What is Premature Ejaculation (PE)?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the name implies, it is the condition where a man ejaculates in a premature or early stage of sex. In Premature ejaculation, ejaculation happens sooner than he or his partner wants, during sex. Ejaculation happens before the real satisfaction or orgasm is attained for both partners,  As a result of this early ejaculation, both the partners would not be sexually satisfied.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A common mistake in a person with premature ejaculation is hurrying. He's worried whether he would ejaculate soon, and he does things in a hurry and tends to finish it as soon as possible. He spends little or no time for foreplay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>How much time does one need to do foreplay? </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first thing to remember is that there is no maximum limit for foreplay, but the minimum should be at least 30 to 40 minutes of foreplay.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Tips &amp; tricks for Handling Triggers for Premature ejaculation while doing foreplay.</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Foreplay time is ultimate, the time when a person gets sexually stimulated. When he engages in foreplay, this stimulation level increases and therefore might be a trigger for ejaculation. So it is important to get away from that trigger to avoid ejaculation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5><strong>Follow these steps for doing foreplay:</strong> (TIPS FOR HANDLING PREMATURE EJACULATION)</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>A:</strong> Start doing the foreplay with your partner. Both the partners should actively take part in foreplay. </li><li><strong>B:</strong> If you get the trigger for ejaculation, immediately stop what you were doing at that time. If that trigger was because of the foreplay done by your partner, ask her to stop that activity. </li><li><strong>C:</strong> Take a break for at least 15 to 20 seconds or Wait until that trigger vanishes. </li><li><strong>D:</strong> You can continue the foreplay Immediately after the trigger disappears.</li><li><strong>E:</strong> Repeat from step <strong>A</strong> to step <strong>E</strong>.</li><li><strong>F:</strong> Continue this for at least 30 to 40 minutes. </li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For some people, some activities trigger more, for instance, oral sex. If you have any such high trigger activities, reduce those activities. Speak to your partner about how you feel and act accordingly. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 id="How-your-Partner-can-help-in-foreplay?">How your Partner can help in foreplay? </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The involvement of your partner plays a very important role in sexual life. With PE, the partner supports is absolutely necessary for <strong><a href="https://ranamedicalhall.com/health-talks/reignite-the-lost-passion-and-intimacy-in-your-love-life/"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">foreplay</span></a></strong> and whole play as well. When the lady partner actively participates in foreplay, the man slowly will become comfortable in doing all the activities like <a href="https://ranamedicalhall.com/health-talks/how-to-express-your-love-to-your-partner/"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">kissing, cuddling, caressing</span></a> etc. When they actively participate in foreplay, slowly he will become capable to handle his triggers while doing foreplay. If she's not active, some extra touch or caressing from her usual activities can trigger him and there is a high chance of ejaculation. So it's very much advisable that both partners should heartfully and actively take part in foreplay. If you take a ratio of foreplay, the activity level of the lady should be at least 40 per cent. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 id="Why-you-need-the-help-of-your-partner?">Why you need the help of your partner?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Indeed you need the help of your partner. While doing foreplay, you have to stop the foreplay when you get a trigger to avoid ejaculation. And should restart it, when the trigger disappears. To do this start and stop effectively, you need the complete support of your partner. Similarly, while intercourse also you will be stopping in between when you have that trigger for ejaculation.

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you have finished with foreplay and perfect postures, it is the time for intercourse. You should be very careful in handling this process, as it gives more trigger for ejaculation.

Intensionally, You should minimise things that increase the trigger. For instance wetness of the partner at that area triggers some men while entering. If so is the case, wipe that wetness before entering. Likewise, you should help yourself to find what triggers you the most and how to get rid of that while doing sex.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Step #B:</strong> <strong>Immediately after entering:</strong> Trigger to ejaculate can immediately start because of the instant sensual feel one gets while entering. As you already have the trigger, and you start stroking at this point, there is a high chance to get <a href="https://ranamedicalhall.com/health-talks/sex-is-thrilling/"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">hyper anxiety</span></a> and ejaculate in a matter of seconds. So It is better to avoid any movements immediately after you entered. Keep it standstill until you are comfortable with the entry part. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Step #C: After you are comfortable with entering: </strong> After you are comfortable with entering slow motion or controlled movements of strokes are recommended for a person with ejaculation issues. This slow pace helps you to control the trigger for ejaculation. </p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5> MEN'S SEXUAL HEALTH NEEDS MORE ATTENTION, ALERTNESS AND AWARENESS.  </h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Tip 1 Personal hygiene</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Personal hygiene is of at most importance when it comes to penis health. Like any other body part, your genital area which is enclosed in underwear almost full day, need frequent washing to stop sweat and bacterias from accumulating and making it free from infections and odour. Always keeping it clean, tidy and groomed helps in your sexual wellness as well as overall body health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4> How to keep it clean?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> The way of cleaning it might seem to be simple, but doing it daily is the bet. Gently wash the penis and groin area at least twice a day with mild soap and water. If not Circumcised then, pull back your foreskin gently and wash underneath.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you don't wash underneath of the foreskin correctly, a cheesy-looking substance called smegma, which is a natural lubricant that keeps the penis moist, may begin to gather,  then smelling starts, and can become a breeding ground for bacteria.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another major problem with the accumulation of smegma can be the difficulty in pulling your foreskin back. There are many who face such situations because of their laziness or ignorance in proper daily cleaning. Redness and swelling of the head of your penis, called&nbsp;balanitis&nbsp;is another problem with unhygienic penis practice. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Proper hygiene helps to keep the penis and related parts like testicles, groin area, scrotum etc, bacteria-free and odour- free.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Circumcised men should also be careful about cleaning their penis by gently washing the penis and genital areas with mild soap and water at least twice a day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h5>How to bring emotional intimacy in your life?</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;In a long-term&nbsp;relationship, couples have to engage in many other things other than a physical relationship. As life goes on, they're tied up with&nbsp;many&nbsp;things such as financial problems, kids, family issues and so on. The saddest part is that partners together discuss everything, plan everything, and make sure everything is well and good in their family BUT never discuss or bother about the issues they face in their physical relationship, which is the most&nbsp;integral part of&nbsp;their love Life. Worst of all, they intentionally or unintentionally ignore&nbsp;the importance of&nbsp;being a good partner in love life. In short, life will definitely become boring and mechanical. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>How can you save yourself from this mechanical life? </h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Repetition kills the magic of Lovemaking. Obviously, doing the same things repeatedly will definitely make things boring. Be&nbsp;creative&nbsp;in doing things. For eg:- Bringing new techniques and methods can make&nbsp;the whole&nbsp;act thrilling and interesting. Keep on changing the way of doing things. Some tips certainly help to change the boredom in your bedroom. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>Perfect Ambience gives a perfect sense. </h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For enjoying those beautiful moments, your senses&nbsp;must be&nbsp;free and open. After all, the stressful&nbsp;ambience&nbsp;makes NO sense here. So to sum up to make sure you are not doing that nonsense in your bedroom. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dress up to make your partner romantic. In fact, Seeing you in a different attractive way definitely takes things to a different level. Start with a good shower, groom well, use romantic&nbsp;fragrance&nbsp;which your partner like and yes!!.. Be ready for an enchanting&nbsp;encounter. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>Foreplay is the best trick. </h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="http://roymedicalhall.com/sextracts.html">Foreplay</a>'s are the best trick for a better play, but unfortunately, rarely used. Just think about the time you spent on this.&nbsp;5minutes&nbsp;or&nbsp;10minutes? , Sometimes less than that, isn't it? But dear people, do it at least half an hour. Many people consider their sexual&nbsp;ability&nbsp;in terms of the time they can stroke their partner. More strokes make them happier and satisfied. But ask your partner before concluding to that point. Your partner can only reach the orgasm or satisfaction level only if she&nbsp;is&nbsp;aroused well. And definitely, foreplay's are the best trick for that. Arouse her well&nbsp;every time, she'll be waiting for you all the time. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h5>Perfect Postures for perfect play. </h5>

<h2> Which sex postures suits you well?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The success of Sex is all about getting the right move in the right place. Couples usually try many postures to make their encounters more pleasurable and fun-filled. There will be many successful and failed attempts. It's better to master one or two sex postures which are comfortable and suits both of you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Factors to be&nbsp;considered before&nbsp;you try for a new posture. The factors you should remember is your&nbsp;Comfortability, Compatibility and Capability.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Why&nbsp;comfortability&nbsp;matters?</h3>

<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both partners should be comfortable in that particular posture. In many cases&nbsp;(for instance: missionary position)&nbsp;comfort of woman will be ignored. She might be suffocating in that position.&nbsp;She's not a couch to lean on or a weight lifting champion to hold you. Please consider that before you get it on.

		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Little drops of water make the mighty ocean… How to express your love to your partner?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A brainstorming quote for the day…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Couples complain about missing intimacy in their life, both emotional and physical intimacy. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What might be the reason for this missing? First and foremost, You're your best judge !!!. This never happens overnight, In fact, its the result of known and unknown ignorance that you make each and every day. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Think about the last time when you said 'I love you' or 'I miss you' to your partner, Can't remember? Check out the below points that can help you to rebuild the intimacy of your life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2> Respect your partner!!!.. Their feelings, their love, their time,… Respect indeed is a beautiful expression of Love…</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Communication is key… Understand their need, their fantasies, their dreams,… Moreover, Let you be the person to whom they can rely on..always…&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be affectionate!!.. Hug and kiss each other for no reason. Indeed, Greet and hug your <a href="http://www.ranamedicalhall.com">partner </a>when you go apart.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be passionate!!!.. Loving and flirting messages are certainly not for lovers alone, try and see how it works. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Possessiveness undoubtedly in any relationship is toxic, obviously it kills the intimacy after a certain limit. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do give space to your partner,&nbsp;perhaps it actually helps to fill the space between you two.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Make woman happy in bed… It's a lot easier than you think…</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Make a woman happy in bed It's a lot easier than you think - You might be facing some sexual abnormalities may be lack of quality erection or some untimely ejaculations or stamina issues or performance anxiety Whatever be your problem, set it aside!! and make her happy in bed Because YOUR happiness is seeing that content smile on HER face</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Is it easy to make her happy?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Definitely!! a big easy YES!!, is the answer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Men get easily stimulated and aroused even by a visual or a chat. They can also reach the orgasmic state easily and fast. But if you're repeatedly facing an early ejaculation issue, treat it well in advance with <a href="/health-talks/ayurvedic-medicine-for-premature-ejaculation/"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Ayurvedic Medicine for Premature Ejaculation</span></a> to avert further headaches. Women, on the other hand, will arouse slowly and the way of reaching orgasm is also a bit different. Women are more emotionally attached to their partner than men. They need both physical and emotional stimulation for getting aroused and of course, more time to get that desire to reach orgasm. Because of this difference in timing to reach orgasm, simultaneous orgasm of man and woman would rarely happen.</p>

<h3>Men can tap this difference to make woman happy in bed, but how?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Build up the desire for love-making by good foreplay and arouse her to the maximum. When she arouses fully give her a good external stimulation in the clitoris and also her G-Spot. You can try 'fingering techniques stimulation' to make her reach <a href="https://roymedicalhall.com/sextracts.html"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">orgasm</span></a>. Do not rush at any point. Do it lovingly, selflessly and wholeheartedly. Discuss with her and do it as per her liking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="/health-talks/does-consistency-in-vaginal-intercourse-matter-in-love-life/"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Consistency in Vaginal Intercourse</span></a> would be definitely the first and foremost preference of your woman to reach orgasm. But For instance, if you have a problem in getting a quality erection, <a href="/treatments/erectile-dysfunction.html"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Erectile Dysfunction curable and affordable treatment</span></a> should be administered at the earliest. Facing a sexual issue, it would be challenging for you. Turning your face from the problem and sinking into despair is not the solution. Make her happy by doing whatever way possible.</p>

		<Title>Instant Pills for your Sexual Arousal?</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Do you rely on instant pills for your sexual arousal? Beware!!.. You are digging your own grave.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How often can you impose 'unnatural sexual arousal/feelings'?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Feelings cannot be created as such, it should be felt from within… The beauty of the whole act is getting all magical emotions naturally and safely. Getting the sensual sexual feeling and satisfaction, every time, using this <span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">'deadly pill'</span> is awful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Before getting addicted to this, just ask yourself: 'WHY' you need it?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the main reasons why people get addicted to pills is their poor erection power. Sex without Erection is unimaginable for many, what's the short cut then??… <strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Pills that satisfy his wills.</span></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take it, Have it, Do it.. yes!!.. All Erection issues are resolved forever. Okk... Wake up! That was just a daydream... Reality is waiting to happen…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Only for Erection issues or more?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These pills are incapable to boost your sexual desire or to resolve your sexual problems but still whether low desire issues or Ejaculation issues or Erection issues or stamina problems… for many people, these pills are their one-stop solution for sexual problems. Without a second thought, They recklessly take it, as if it can rectify all sexual issues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://ranamedicalhall.com/health-talks/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/do-you-rely-on-instant-libido-enhancers-dr-althaf-ibrahem-rana-1024x813.jpg" alt="instant pills for your sexual arousal" data-id="1954" data-full-url="https://ranamedicalhall.com/health-talks/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/do-you-rely-on-instant-libido-enhancers-dr-althaf-ibrahem-rana.jpg" data-link="https://ranamedicalhall.com/health-talks/?attachment_id=1954" class="wp-image-1954"/></figure></li></ul></figure>

<h5>Will this pill… really helps ?</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There's a false norm that Erection problem or any sexual issues like anxiety problem or ejaculation problems etc can be solved forever, by having these pills. First and foremost, the mind plays before any pills. Obviously He's taking pills for the play, to get a quality Erection and to have satisfaction. In short, he's preparing himself, his mind and body for the whole act. But think of another scenario, for instance, take those pills without any mental preparation or desire for sex and engage in some other activities other than sex-related topics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5> What are your expectations then?</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A hard rock Erection and super excited mood for a never-ending sumptuous play!!!… You are mistaken... Nothing will happen as you expected. Here Indeed, Mind is your master. Then why not Tap that power of the mind for getting normal arousal and Erection. But unfortunately, If you have an Erection issue or any other sexual problems, getting a normal quality Erection and maintaining it won't be easy but that doesn't mean taking these pills are the ultimate solution for your sexual problems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These pills can only flush some blood into penis and for the time being you're erected. These pills are not the ultimate solution for any of your underlying sexual problems, but only a quick-fix solution. </p>

<p>Don't do sex… make love instead…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br> Sounds embarrassing? Well!!, There is lot many differences in doing mere sex and making love.<br> For many, sex is just penetrating, some nasty strokes, getting something named as orgasm, period!! And getting back to routines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br> Love-making is when you merge sex and love together with your Love and you get a soothing, content feel that fills your heart, soul and body the warmth of fullness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br> Foreplay, foreplay and more foreplay is the key. Know what your partner wants from you, provide it selflessly and your wishes will be granted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[1591]} -->
<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://ranamedicalhall.com/health-talks/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/dont-do-sex-make-love-instead.jpg" alt="" data-id="1591" data-full-url="https://ranamedicalhall.com/health-talks/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/dont-do-sex-make-love-instead.jpg" data-link="https://ranamedicalhall.com/health-talks/?attachment_id=1591" class="wp-image-1591"/></figure></li></ul></figure>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br> There's a misconception that foreplay and overall sexual activity is the sole responsibility of man alone. But love making is not a one man show. Give as much as you can to get back what you wish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br> Wait.. Do you remember the beautiful old days of love making ? Or Is it like you have never experienced a wholesome orgasm?<br> Worry not !!! , We can help you get it back from your memories. Experience that sensual feel again … It's time for a love making.</p>

<h1>Covid -19 Coronavirus … What, why and How!!</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>What actually is COVID-19?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>COVID-19 is a very infectious disease which is caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. The first outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. This new virus and disease were unknown before that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>What can be the common symptoms of COVID-19? People may experience:</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Running nose</li><li>Sore throat</li><li>Cough</li><li>Fever</li><li>Difficulty in breathing (severe cases)</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 (coronavirus) are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. But in Some cases, patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhoea as well</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Initially, these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. However, some infected people don’t develop any symptoms and they don't feel unwell. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Of course, most people (about 80%) will recover from this disease without any special treatment. But, Around 1 out of every 6 people who get COVID-19 can become seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>  Understandably, older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Specifically, people with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>Wash your hands frequently</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most importantly clean your hands frequently and thoroughly with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why?&nbsp;Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub is absolutely necessary because it kills viruses that may be on your hands as a result can save you from getting infected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[1618]} -->
<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://ranamedicalhall.com/health-talks/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/corona-covid-19-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" data-id="1618" data-full-url="https://ranamedicalhall.com/health-talks/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/corona-covid-19-2.jpg" data-link="https://ranamedicalhall.com/health-talks/?attachment_id=1618" class="wp-image-1618"/></figure></li></ul></figure>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Maintain social distancing</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Experts say avoiding close contact or 'social distancing'  is the key to slowing coronavirus. Firstly, avoid situations where there are crowds and gatherings for decreasing the frequency of interactions and thereby reducing the risk of spreading coronavirus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> First and foremost our ultimate goal is to break the chain of transmission. By social distancing, you can minimize not just the risk to yourself but also the risk from you potentially transmitting to other friends and families in your social circle. Every individual is an opportunity to break that transmission, so of course, it is an important individual obligation and responsibility to 'keep the distance'.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most importantly, you should maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why?&nbsp;When someone coughs or sneezes obviously, they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth. This may contain the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">virus </a>and If you are very close, you may breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 coronavirus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why?&nbsp;Touching different surfaces with hands can pick up viruses. If hands get contaminated, it can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, eventually, the virus can enter your body, infect you and finally, will make you sick.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Practice respiratory hygiene</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Practice good respiratory hygiene. Cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue or handkerchief when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Make sure you, and the people around you, are following good respiratory hygiene practices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why?&nbsp;Droplets from coughing and sneezing spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>if you feel unwell and have symptoms like fever, cough and difficulty breathing etc immediately seek medical attention. Strictly follow the directions of your local health authority.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why?&nbsp;National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Immediately Seeking medical help will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will help to protect you and also help to prevent the spread of <a href="http://roymedicalhall.com/treatments/herpes.html">viruses </a>and other infections as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Stay informed and religiously follow all the advice given by your healthcare provider.</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's equally important to stay informed on the latest developments about COVID-19. Follow the advice given by your healthcare providers and authorities on how to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stay informed on the latest developments about COVID-19. Follow the advice given by your healthcare providers and authorities on how to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why?&nbsp;Obviously, National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on whether COVID-19 is spreading in your area. They are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No need to be panic. Obviously, there's no need to be panic about the situation if we follow strict government guidelines. Proper hygiene and care can prevent you. Stay informed and Stay Safe!</p>

		<Title>Covid-19 and Children</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Covid-19 and children</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> COVID 19 and children   - ARE OUR CHILDREN SAFE? - (<a href="https://ranamedicalhall.com/health-talks/break-the-chain-break-the-covid-19-coronavirus/">Coronavirus</a>) Infections are continuing to soar and they are quickly reaching the most vulnerable. Parents are worried about the health and safety of their children. How can we protect and safeguard our little ones? Here are some precautionary methods that you can be aware and teach your children as well, to prevent from getting infected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2> Does COVID-19&nbsp;affect children?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a new virus and we do not know enough yet about how it affects children or pregnant women. However, We know it is possible for people of any age to be infected with the virus, but so far there have been relatively few cases of COVID-19 reported among children. The virus is fatal in rare cases, especially among older people with pre-existing medical conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>How to avoid the risk of infection?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy. Here are four&nbsp;precautions you and of course, your family can take to avoid infection:<br> &nbsp;<br> Precaution #1 First and foremost, Wash hands frequently using soap and water or can use alcohol-based hand rub as well. Teach your children to wash hands properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4> What is the best way to wash hands properly?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li> Wet hands with running water</li><li>Apply enough soap to cover wet hands</li><li>Scrub all surfaces of the hands – including the back of hands, between fingers and under nails – for at least 20 seconds. </li><li>Rinse thoroughly with running water</li><li>Dry hands with a clean cloth or single-use towel</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ask them to Wash hands often, especially before eating; after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; and going to the bathroom.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;#2 Secondly, ask them to Cover mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue when coughing or sneezing. Finally, Dispose of used tissue immediately.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>#3 In fact, Avoid your children's close contact with anyone who has cold or flu-like symptoms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>#4 Seek medical care immediately if you or your child has a fever, cough or difficulty breathing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>How to make your child aware of corona?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As public conversations around coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increase, obviously, children may worry about themselves, their family, and friends getting ill with COVID-19. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Parents, family members, and also other trusted adults can play an important role in helping children make sense of what they hear in a way that is honest, accurate, and as a result, can minimize anxiety or fear. Of course, Adults should guide the children through conversations and make them understand about COVID-19 and ways they can avoid getting and spreading the disease.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>General principles for talking to children</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remain calm and reassuring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Firstly, Remember that children will react to both what you say and how you say it. They will pick up cues from the conversations you have with them and with others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Make yourself available to listen and to talk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Make time to talk. Be sure children know they can come to you when they have questions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Avoid language that might blame others and lead to&nbsp;stigma.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remember that viruses can make anyone sick, regardless of a person’s race or ethnicity. So Avoid making assumptions about who might have COVID-19.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pay attention to what children see or hear on television, radio, or online.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Consider reducing the amount of screen time focused on COVID-19. Too much information on one topic obviously can lead to anxiety.</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Provide information that is honest and accurate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most importantly, Give children information that is truthful and appropriate for the age and developmental level of the child. Talk to children about how some stories on COVID-19 on the Internet and social media may be based on rumours and inaccurate information.</p>

Get children into a handwashing habit. Teach them to wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food as well. If soap and water are not available, teach them to use hand sanitizer. Hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol. Supervise young children when they use hand sanitizer to prevent swallowing alcohol, especially in schools and <a href="https://www.who.int/">childcare </a>facilities.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Psychological impacts of sexual issues.</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main problem with almost all people with some sort of sexual issues<br>is that they think, it's just a small issue and will be solved by itself. In the beginning, People are very confident about themselves. Every passing day, their motto is 'better luck next time' for a better play. But, when failure episode continues, it'll definitely affect the mental state of that person.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They lose their confidence, interest and of course, will be stressed. Certainly, stress worsens the person's sexual problems, because stress is the biggest 'enemy' of Sex and needless to say, it'll eventually end up in total disasters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you realise that there is a Sexual problem, which affects your performance and quality of erection, then don't wait for an eternity to solve it. A sexual problem is not a Sin. But many are sceptical about it. It's like any other ailments that need to be treated and cured. Sex is the backbone of the marital relationship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many men experience a problem with sexual activities from time to time. However, when the problems are persistent, they can cause distress for the man and his partner and obviously, have a negative impact on their relationship.<br>If you consistently experience sexual function problems, address it without any hesitation and see your doctor for evaluation and treatment.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>പുരുഷൻമാരിൽ&nbsp;&nbsp;കണ്ടു വരുന്ന ഒരു പ്രധാന ലൈംഗിക പ്രശ്നമാണ് ശീഘ്രസ്ഖലനം.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ലൈംഗിക ബന്ധത്തിന്റെ സമയത്ത് പലർക്കും&nbsp;സ്ഖലനം നടത്താനുള്ള തോന്നൽ അഥവാ ട്രിഗ്ഗർ അനുഭവപ്പെടും. എന്നാൽ ആ തോന്നലുകളെ നിയന്ത്രിച്ച്‌, തന്റെയും, തന്റെ പങ്കാളിയുടെയും ഇഷ്ടപ്രകാരം ലൈംഗിക സമയം നീട്ടി, ഇരുവർക്കും പൂർണമായ&nbsp;&nbsp;രതിമൂർച്ച എത്തും വരെ ലൈംഗിക ബന്ധം തുടരാൻ അവർക്ക് സാധിക്കുന്നു. എന്നാൽ&nbsp; ശീഘ്രസ്ഖലനം ഉള്ള ഒരാൾക്ക്, ലൈംഗിക ബന്ധം തുടങ്ങി, വളരെ പെട്ടെന്നു തന്നെ, ചെറിയ ലൈംഗികോദ്ദീപനം കൊണ്ട് പോലും നിയന്ത്രിക്കുവാനാവാതെ,<br>സ്വമേധയ അല്ലാതെ, അപ്രതീക്ഷിതമായി സ്ഖലനം സംഭവിക്കുകയും, തന്മൂലം ലൈംഗിക ബന്ധം തുടരാൻ സാധിക്കാതെയും വരുന്നു.</p>

<p>പലർക്കും പല രീതിയിൽ ആണ് ശീഘ്രസ്ഖലനം സംഭവിക്കുന്നത്.&nbsp;ചിലപ്പോൾ ചിലർക്ക് ബാഹ്യലീലകളിലിൽ /&nbsp;ഫോർപ്ലേയിൽ ഏർപ്പെടുമ്പോൾ&nbsp; തന്നെ സ്ഖലനം സംഭവിക്കുന്നു,&nbsp;ചിലർക്കാകട്ടെ യോനി പ്രവേശന ശ്രമം നടത്തുമ്പോൾ&nbsp;സ്ഖലനം നടക്കുകയും,&nbsp;&nbsp;അതിന്റെ ഫലമായി ഉദ്ധാരണം നഷ്ടപ്പെടുകയും ലൈംഗിക ബന്ധം തുടരാൻ സാധിക്കാതെ വരികയും ചെയ്യും. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>ഒരു മനുഷ്യനിൽ ലൈംഗിക പ്രശ്നങ്ങൾ മൂലം ഉണ്ടാകുന്ന മാനസിക പ്രശ്നങ്ങൾ വളരെ വലുതാണ്. ആദ്യമാദ്യം ഉണ്ടാകുന്ന പരാജയങ്ങൾ കാര്യമാക്കാതെ, വളരെ ആത്മവിശ്വാസത്തോടെ, അവർ <strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">"അടുത്ത ശ്രമത്തിൽ"</span></strong> ശരിയാക്കാം, എന്നു കരുതുന്നു. ഈ <strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">"മൂഢവിചാരം"</span></strong> ജീവിതാവസാനം വരെ കൊണ്ട് നടക്കുന്നവരും അനവധിയാണ്.&nbsp;ശ്രമങ്ങൾ ഒന്നിനു പിറകെ മറ്റൊന്നായി അമ്പേ&nbsp;പരാചയപെടുമ്പോൾ, ആത്മവിശ്വാസം നഷ്ടപ്പെടുന്നു. </p>

<h2>ഒരു ലോക് ഡൗൺ അപാരത --- ലൈംഗിക വേഴ്ചയിലെ വീഴ്ചകൾ…</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>കുറേ ദിവങ്ങളായി….. ഇന്ന് എന്തായാലും അവൾടെ പരാതി മാറ്റണം.<br>ലോക്ക് ഡൗൺ ആയതിനാലും … വേറെ പ്രത്യേകിച്ച് പണിയൊന്നും ഇല്ലാത്തതു കൊണ്ടും….സമയത്തെ പഴിക്കാൻ പറ്റാതായി. <strong><span style="color:#f8f3f3" class="has-inline-color">ലൈംഗിക വേഴ്ച - ലൈംഗിക പ്രശ്നങ്ങൾ വീഴ്ചകൾ</span></strong></p>

<p>ഇനിയും അവളുടെ വികാരങ്ങളെ മൈൻഡ് ചെയ്തില്ലെങ്കിൽ അവൾ ചിലപ്പോൾ വല്ല കടുംകൈ ചെയ്തെന്നിരിക്കും. അമ്മിക്കല്ലിനൊന്നും അടുക്കളയിൽ ഉപയോഗം ഇല്ലെങ്കിലും ഒക്കെ അവിടെ തന്നെ ഇരിപ്പുണ്ട് എന്ന് മറക്കരുതല്ലോ!!…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>നോക്കിക്കോ…<br>ഇന്ന് ഞാൻ തകർക്കും, ഉറപ്പ് !!….<br>ഈ ഉറപ്പ്‌ , 'കുറുപ്പിൻറെ ഉറപ്പ് ' ആകാതിരുന്നാൽ കൊള്ളാം. കഴിഞ്ഞ തവണയും അത് തന്നെയായിരുന്നു സംഭവിച്ചത്.</p>

<p>പോരാത്തതിന് എവർഗ്രീൻ റൊമാൻറിക് പാട്ടുകളും മുറിയിലാകെ നിറയുന്ന സുഗന്ധവും സുന്ദരിയായ അവളും … മനസ്സു കൊണ്ടും ശരീരം കൊണ്ടും രണ്ടു പേരും വളരെ ആഗ്രഹിച്ചിരുന്നു . കെട്ടിപിടിച്ചും ഉമ്മ വെച്ചും കുറേ സ്നേഹിച്ചു, പരസ്പരം ലാളിച്ചു, നന്നായി തലോടി…. എൻറെ ഓരോ ചുംബനങ്ങളും ലാളനകളും അവൾ നന്നായി ആസ്വദിക്കുകയും പ്രതികരിക്കുകയും ചെയ്തിരുന്നു. പക്ഷേ അവളുടെ തിരിച്ചുള്ള ലാളനകൾ എനിക്ക് താങ്ങാവുന്നതിലും അപ്പുറം ആയിരുന്നു. പലപ്പോഴും എല്ലാം കൈവിട്ടു പോകുമോ, എന്നു പോലും തോന്നിയിരുന്നു . പണ്ടും, പലപ്പോഴും, എല്ലാം നഷ്ടപ്പെടുമെന്ന തോന്നൽ ഉണ്ടാകുമായിരുന്നെങ്കിലും, ഇപ്പോൾ അത് വളരെ കൂടുന്നതായി തോന്നുന്നുണ്ട്.</p>

<p>അവളുടെ മൂഡും എൻറെ മൂഡും നന്നായി കൂടിയത്തിനുശേഷമാണെല്ലോ ഞാൻ ശ്രമിച്ചത്, ഒന്നോ രണ്ടോ മിനിറ്റ് പോയിക്കാണും അപ്പോഴേക്കും ദേ കിടക്കുന്നു, എല്ലാം അവിടെ കഴിഞ്ഞു. അവളുടെ വാടിയ മുഖം കണ്ടപ്പോഴാണ് അടുത്ത ഒരു ശ്രമം കൂടി നടത്താം എന്ന് വിചാരിച്ചത്. നാശം! കുറേ നേരം കഴിഞ്ഞ് ശ്രമിച്ചിട്ടു പോലും അതും നടന്നില്ല.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ലൈംഗിക പ്രശ്നങ്ങൾ അലട്ടുന്ന ഒരു ശരാശരി മനുഷ്യൻറെ വിചാരവികാരങ്ങൾ ആണ് ചെറിയ തമാശ രൂപേണ അവതരിപ്പിച്ചിരിക്കുന്നത്. ഇത് വായിക്കുമ്പോൾ പലർക്കും തങ്ങളുടെ അവസ്ഥ ഇതുമായി ബന്ധപ്പെടുത്താൻ സാധിക്കും. ലൈംഗിക പ്രശ്നങ്ങളെ മറ്റ്‌ അസുഖങ്ങളെ പോലെ തന്നെ ഒരു സാധാരണ രോഗാവസ്ഥയായി കണക്കാക്കാത്ത പല ആളുകളും നമ്മുടെ നാട്ടിൽ ഉണ്ട്. ലൈംഗികതയെപ്പറ്റിയുള്ള  ചർച്ചയ്ക്കോ, അതിനെക്കുറിച്ച് ശരിയായ അറിവ് നേടാനോ അവർ മുതിരുന്നില്ല.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>തൻറെ ലൈംഗിക പ്രശ്നങ്ങളെ കുറിച്ച് പങ്കാളിയോട് തുറന്നു പറയാൻ ധൈര്യമുള്ളവർ എത്രപേരുണ്ട് . ലൈംഗിക പ്രശ്നങ്ങൾക്ക് ഒരു വിദഗ്ധ <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/althaf-ibrahem-rana/" target="_blank">ഡോക്ടറുടെ </a>ചികിത്സ തേടുന്നത് തൻറെ പുരുഷത്വത്തിനു തന്നെ നാണക്കേടായി ചിലർ കരുതുന്നു. ലൈംഗിക വിദ്യാഭ്യാസത്തിൻറെ അപര്യാപ്തത തന്നെയാണ് ഇതിന്റെയൊക്കെ പ്രധാന കാരണം. പലരും കരുതുന്നതു പോലെ ലൈംഗിക പ്രശ്നങ്ങൾ പാരമ്പര്യം ആകണമെന്നില്ല. മറ്റ് പല ശാരീരിക-മാനസിക അവസ്ഥകൾ ലൈംഗിക പ്രശ്നത്തിന് കാരണമാകാം. അനാവശ്യ സ്ട്രെസ്സ്, ടെൻഷൻ, മാനസിക പിരമുറുക്കങ്ങൾ, ആത്മ വിശ്വാസക്കുറവ് തുടങ്ങിയവയെല്ലാം ലൈംഗികതയെ പ്രതികൂലമായി<br>ബാധിക്കും.</p>

<h4>ഒരു വിദഗ്ധ ഡോക്ടറുടെ സേവനം തേടാതെ സ്വയം ചികിത്സിച്ചും...</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>...കൂട്ടുകാരോട് ചോദിച്ചും, അശ്ലീല ചിത്രങ്ങൾ കണ്ടും, പൊടിക്കൈകൾ തേടിയും, മുറിവൈദ്യത്തിനു പിന്നാലെ പാഞ്ഞും അവൻ തൻറെ യൗവനവും ജീവിതവും നശിപ്പിച്ചു കളയുന്നു. ഇവിടെ ഒരു തെറ്റും ചെയ്യാത്ത അയാളുടെ പങ്കാളിയും ബലിയാടാവുകയാണ്. ഓർക്കുക, ലൈംഗിക സുഖം ഔദാര്യമല്ല, അവരുടെ അവകാശമാണ്.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ഒട്ടുമിക്ക ലൈംഗിക പ്രശ്നങ്ങളും യഥാസമയം ചികിത്സിച്ചു ഭേദമാക്കാവുന്നതാണ്. സമയം വളരെ വിലപ്പെട്ടതാണ്, ലൈംഗിക പ്രശ്നങ്ങൾ നിസ്സാരമായി കരുതി, വേണ്ട വിധത്തിൽ ചികിത്സിക്കാതെ, അതിനെ ഗൗനിക്കാതെയിരുന്നാൽ അത് നിങ്ങളുടെ സ്വകാര്യ ജീവിതത്തിൽ വലിയ തിരിച്ചടികൾ ഉണ്ടാക്കും.</p>

<p>സ്ത്രീ പുരുഷ ലൈംഗിക ആരോഗ്യം - ഇന്ത്യയിൽ പ്രായപൂർത്തിയായ സ്ത്രീയും പുരുഷനും തങ്ങളുടെ ഇഷ്ടത്തിനൊത്ത്, സദാചാര ക്രമങ്ങൾ അനുവർത്തിച്ചു, സെക്സ് ആസ്വദിക്കുന്നത് വിവാഹത്തിനു ശേഷമാണ്. ദാമ്പത്യ ബന്ധത്തിൽ, ലൈംഗികത മാത്രമല്ല ആധാരം, എന്നിരുന്നാലും വിവാഹ ജീവിതത്തിൽ നിർണ്ണായകമായ ഒരു പങ്കു വഹിക്കുന്നു 'സെക്സ് ' </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>അറേഞ്ച് മാര്യേജ് ആണെങ്കിലും ലൗ മാര്യേജ് ആണെങ്കിലും, വിവാഹ ബന്ധത്തിലേർപ്പെടുന്ന സ്ത്രീക്കും പുരുഷനും ലൈംഗികതയെപ്പറ്റി വ്യത്യസ്ത കാഴ്ചപ്പാടുകളും, താൽപര്യങ്ങളും ഇഷ്ടങ്ങളും ഉണ്ടാകാറുണ്ട്. ഇത് സ്വാഭാവികവുമാണ്. എന്നാൽ ലൈംഗികതയെ പറ്റിയുള്ള അഭിപ്രായ വ്യത്യാസങ്ങൾ ഒരു പരിധിയിൽ കൂടുന്നത് ദമ്പതികൾ തമ്മിലുള്ള സുഖകരമായ ലൈംഗിക ബന്ധത്തെ ബാധിക്കുകയും, അവർക്കിടയിൽ ഊഷ്മളമായ ലൈംഗിക ബന്ധം കുറഞ്ഞു വരാൻ കാരണമാവുകയും ചെയ്യുന്നു.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>എന്ത് കൊണ്ടാണ് സ്ത്രീ പുരുഷ ലൈംഗിക ബന്ധത്തിൽ വിള്ളലുകൾ ഉണ്ടാകുന്നത്?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>സ്ത്രീ പുരുഷ ലൈംഗിക ആരോഗ്യമാണ് ദാമ്പത്യ ജീവിതത്തിന്റെ അടിത്തറ. അതിനുണ്ടാകുന്ന പ്രശ്നങ്ങൾ അവരുടെ സ്വകാര്യ ജീവിതത്തിന്റെ നിറം മങ്ങാൻ കാരണമാകുന്നു. സ്ത്രീ പുരുഷ ലൈംഗിക ആരോഗ്യം എന്നാൽ ശാരീരികവും മാനസികവുമായ ആരോഗ്യമാണ്. ഇവയെ ബാധിക്കുന്ന ചെറുതും വലുതുമായി എല്ലാ പ്രശ്നങ്ങളും، ഒരാളുടെ ലൈംഗിക ആരോഗ്യത്തെയും ബാധിക്കുന്നു.</p>

<p>ലൈംഗികതയും മനസ്സും തമ്മിൽ അഭേദ്യ ബന്ധമാണുള്ളത്‌. എത്ര മൂഡിൽ ആണെങ്കിലും മനസ്സിനു ഇഷ്ടപ്പെടാത്ത ഒരു ചെറിയ കാര്യം മതി എല്ലാം താറുമാറാകാൻ. മനസ്സിനെയും ലൈംഗികതയെയും ആഴത്തിൽ ബാധിക്കുന്ന പ്രശ്നങ്ങൾ പലതാണ്. ചില സാഹചര്യങ്ങൾ, ചിന്തകൾ, <a href="http://ഉദ്ധാരണശേഷിക്കുറവ്-ശീഘ്">മാനസിക </a>സമ്മർദ്ദം, മാനസിക പിരിമുറുക്കം, വിഷാദം, ആത്മവിശ്വാസക്കുറവ്, തുടങ്ങിയ മാനസിക പ്രശ്നങ്ങൾ എല്ലാം സുഖകരമായ ലൈംഗികവേഴ്ചയെ ബാധിക്കുന്നതാണ്.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ചിലരിൽ പ്രത്യേകിച്ച് കാരണങ്ങൾ ഒന്നും ഇല്ലാതെ തന്നെ ലൈംഗികതയിൽ നിന്ന് അവർ മാറി നിൽക്കുന്നത് കാണാറുണ്ട്. സ്ഥിരതയുള്ള ലൈംഗികബന്ധം ഒരു വലിയ കാര്യമായി അവരുടെ ജീവിതത്തിൽ തോന്നാത്തത് ആവാം അതിനൊരു കാരണം. എന്നാൽ ഇക്കൂട്ടർ തങ്ങളുടെ പങ്കാളികളുടെ സെക്സിലുള്ള താത്പര്യം കൂടി കണക്കിൽ എടുത്തിട്ടാണോ ഈ ഒഴിഞ്ഞുമാറൽ നടത്തുന്നത് എന്ന് സ്വയം ചിന്തിക്കുക.</p>

<p>എന്നു വേണ്ട സംശയങ്ങളുടെ ഒരു പെരുമഴ തന്നെ മനസ്സിൽ എപ്പോഴും നടക്കുന്നു. ലൈംഗികതയെ കുറിച്ചുള്ള അറിവില്ലായ്മയും, ആത്മവിശ്വാസക്കുറവും ആണ് ഇക്കൂട്ടരെ കൊണ്ട് എപ്പോഴും ഇങ്ങനെ ചിന്തിപ്പിക്കുന്നത് .</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ഇങ്ങനെയുള്ള ഒരാൾക്ക് ഒരിക്കലും സെക്സ് ആസ്വദിക്കാൻ സാധ്യമല്ല. കടിഞ്ഞാൺ ഇല്ലാത്ത കുതിര പോലെയാണ് മനസ്സ് പക്ഷേ ആവശ്യമില്ലാത്ത ചിന്തകളിൽനിന്നും സംശയങ്ങളിൽ നിന്നും മനസ്സിനെ അകറ്റി നിർത്തുക, അതിലാണു നമ്മുടെ വിജയം.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>സെക്സിൽ ശരീരികാരോഗ്യത്തിന് വളരെ വലിയ സ്ഥാനം ഉണ്ട്. ശാരീരികാരോഗ്യത്തെ ബാധിക്കുന്ന അമിതവണ്ണം, കൊളസ്ട്രോൾ, ഡയബറ്റിസ്, രക്തസമ്മർദ്ദം, പ്രോസ്ട്രേറ്റ് പ്രശ്നങ്ങൾ, ക്യാൻസർ, തുടങ്ങിയ പല അസുഖങ്ങളും തീർച്ചയായും ഒരാളുടെ ലൈംഗികതയേയും ബാധിക്കുന്നു. ജീവിത ശൈലിയിൽ ഉള്ള മാറ്റങ്ങൾ കൊണ്ട് ഒരു പരുതി വരെ നമുക്ക്‌ ഇവയെ ചെറുത്തു നിർത്താൻ സാധിക്കും.</p>

<p>ജീവിതത്തിൻറെ ഏതെങ്കിലുമൊരു ഘട്ടത്തിൽ സെക്സ് ആസ്വദിച്ചിട്ടുള്ള ഏതൊരാൾക്കും, സെക്സ്, ആനന്ദവും, മനോഹരമായ ഓർമ്മകളും, അനുഭവങ്ങളും നൽകുന്നു. എന്നാൽ ചിലർക്ക് കാലം ചെല്ലും തോറും<br>പതിയെ പതിയെ സെക്സിൽ താൽപര്യം കുറയുകയും, ലൈംഗിക വിരക്തിയിലേക്ക് എത്തിപ്പെടുകയും ചെയ്യാറുണ്ട്. <span style="color:#f6f8f9" class="has-inline-color">ഉദ്ധാരണശേഷിക്കുറവ് ശീഘ്രസ്ഖലനം ലിംഗ വലുപ്പം</span></p>

<p>ലൈംഗിക ആസക്തി കുറയാൻ പല കാരണങ്ങൾ ഉണ്ടാകാം. ശാരീരികവും മാനസികവുമായ ആരോഗ്യം അല്ലെങ്കിൽ ഉന്മേഷമാണ് സെക്സിന്റെ അടിസ്ഥാനം. പല ചേരുവകൾ ഉചിതമായ അളവിൽ ചേർക്കുമ്പോൾ സെക്സ് ആസ്വാദ്യകരം ആകുന്നു.</p>

<h2>സെക്സും യാഥാർത്ഥ്യവും</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>സെക്സ് എല്ലാവർക്കും മനോഹരമായ വികാരം തന്നെയാണ് . എന്നാൽ വിവാഹശേഷം ജീവിതത്തിൻറെ നഗ്ന സത്യത്തിലേക്ക് കടക്കുമ്പോൾ , ജീവിത പ്രാരാബ്ധങ്ങൾ ഏറുമ്പോൾ, നാം സ്വപ്നം കണ്ട പോലെ ഒരു ജീവിതം ആയിരിക്കുകയില്ല നമ്മുടെ മുന്നിലുള്ളത്. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>പലവിധമായ ജീവിത പ്രശ്നങ്ങൾ, ജീവിതസാഹചര്യങ്ങൾ, സാമ്പത്തിക പരാധീനതകൾ, കുടുംബ പ്രശ്നങ്ങൾ,  ഭാര്യാഭർത്താക്കന്മാർക്കിടയിൽ ഉള്ള വഴക്കുകൾ, ശാരീരിക അസ്വസ്ഥതകൾ, മാനസിക പ്രശ്നങ്ങൾ തുടങ്ങിയവയൊക്കെ ഏറി വരികയും അത് സെക്സിനോടുള്ള താൽപ്പര്യം കുറയാൻ കാരണമാകുകയും ചെയ്യുന്നു. <span class="has-inline-color has-very-dark-gray-color">എന്താണ് ഇതിനൊരു പ്രതിവിധി ??.. നമുക്ക് നോക്കാം..</span></p>

<h2>ലൈംഗികതയും ശാരീരിക ആരോഗ്യവും.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>സെക്സിന് ഏറ്റവും അത്യന്താപേക്ഷിതമായ ഒരു ഘടകമാണ് ശാരീരിക ആരോഗ്യം. ശാരീരിക അസ്വസ്ഥതകൾ ഉള്ള ഒരാൾക്ക് പൂർണ്ണമായും സെക്സ് ആസ്വദിക്കാൻ സാധ്യമല്ല. പല തരത്തിലുള്ള അസുഖങ്ങൾ... </p>

<p>ഉദാഹരണം ഹൃദ്രോഗം, ബ്ലഡ് പ്രഷർ, ഡയബറ്റിസ്, ക്യാൻസർ, പ്രോസ്റ്റേറ്റ് പ്രശ്നങ്ങൾ തുടങ്ങിയ രോഗങ്ങൾ എല്ലാം സെക്സിനെ പ്രതികൂലമായി ബാധിക്കുന്നു. ശാരീരിക അസ്വസ്ഥതകൾ അല്ലെങ്കിൽ അസുഖങ്ങൾ വളരെ നേരത്തെ തന്നെ തിരിച്ചറിയുകയും, അതിന് ഉചിതമായ ചികിത്സ തേടുകയും ചെയ്താൽ നമുക്ക് അസുഖങ്ങളെ വരുതിയിൽ നിർത്താൻ സാധിക്കും. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ഇതിനായി വിദഗ്ധനായ ഒരു ഡോക്ടറുടെ സേവനം തേടേണ്ടതാണ്. ചില അസുഖങ്ങൾക്കുള്ള മരുന്നുകൾ ഉദ്ധാരണ ശേഷി കുറയ്ക്കാൻ കാരണമാകാറുണ്ട് . അങ്ങനെ തോന്നിയാൽ യാതൊരു മടിയും വിചാരിക്കാതെ നിങ്ങളുടെ ഡോക്ടറോട് കാര്യങ്ങൾ തുറന്നു സംസാരിക്കുകയും അതിനുള്ള പ്രതിവിധി വളരെ പെട്ടെന്ന് തന്നെ തേടേണ്ടതും വളരെ അത്യാവശ്യമാണ്.</p>

<h2>സെക്സും അമിതവണ്ണവും.</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>സാധാരണഗതിയിൽ അമിതവണ്ണമുള്ള ഒരാൾക്ക് സെക്സ്നോടുള്ള താൽപര്യം കുറയുക സ്വാഭാവികമാണ് . അമിതവണ്ണം ഉള്ള ഒരാൾക്ക് സെക്സ് ചെയ്യാൻ മടിയും ബുദ്ധിമുട്ടും ഉണ്ടാകാൻ സാധ്യത ഏറെയാണ്. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>സെക്സിൽ പുതിയ പുതിയ പൊസിഷനുകൾ പരീക്ഷിക്കാനും അമിതവണ്ണമുള്ളവർ കഷ്ടപ്പെടും. അടിവയറ്റിലും മറ്റും അടിഞ്ഞു കൂടിയ അമിതകൊഴുപ്പ് കാരണം പൂർണമായ ഉദ്ധാരണ ശേഷി പോലും ലഭിക്കാൻ ബുദ്ധിമുട്ട് അനുഭവപ്പെടാറുണ്ട്.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ഉചിതമായ വ്യായാമവും ആഹാര രീതിയും കൊണ്ട് അമിത വണ്ണം ഒഴിവാക്കാനും അതു വഴി സെക്സിനോടുള്ള താൽപര്യം കൂട്ടാനും മറ്റു ശാരീരിക അസ്വസ്ഥതകളിൽ നിന്നും രക്ഷ നേടാനും സാധിക്കും.</p>

<h2>സെക്സും ദുശ്ശീലങ്ങളും.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>പുകവലി, മദ്യപാനം, മയക്കുമരുന്ന് തുടങ്ങിയ ദുശ്ശീലങ്ങൾ സെക്സിന്റെ ശത്രുവാണ്. ഇത്തരത്തിലുള്ള ദുശീലങ്ങൾ ജീവിതശൈലി രോഗങ്ങൾക്ക് കാരണമാകുന്നു. മാത്രമല്ല ഇവയെല്ലാം തന്നെ കാലക്രമേണ ഉദ്ധാരണ ശേഷിയെ ബാധിക്കുകയും മറ്റ് ലൈംഗിക രോഗങ്ങൾക്ക് കാരണമാകുകയും ചെയ്യുന്നു. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>അതിനാൽ ഈ ദുശ്ശീലങ്ങൾ നമ്മുടെ ജീവിതത്തിൽ നിന്നും മാറ്റേണ്ടത് സെക്സിന് മാത്രമല്ല നമ്മുടെ ജീവന്റെ നിലനിൽപ്പിനും അത്യാവശ്യമാണ് .</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>കുടുംബ ജീവിതത്തിൽ സെക്സിനുള്ള പ്രാധാന്യം എല്ലാവർക്കും അറിവുള്ളതാണ്. ഭാര്യാഭർത്താക്കന്മാർ തമ്മിലുള്ള സ്നേഹത്തിനും കരുതലിനും പരസ്പര വിശ്വാസത്തിനും ദൃഢമായ ദാമ്പത്യ ബന്ധത്തിനും<br>എല്ലാം സെക്സ് ഒരു പ്രധാന പങ്കു വഹിക്കുന്നു. </p>

<p>പ്രശ്നങ്ങൾ എല്ലാവരുടെയും ജീവിതത്തിൽ ഉണ്ടാകാറുണ്ട് അത് എങ്ങനെ ബുദ്ധിപരമായും സമാധാനപരമായും കൈകാര്യം ചെയ്യാം എന്നതിലാണ് കാര്യം. </p>

<!-- /wp:uagb/advanced-heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Safety should be the first and foremost thing that one should be aware of while having sex during this pandemic, especially with a new partner, multiple partners or an unknown partner. In this Post corona period, be very careful or to be precise, strictly avoid sex with an unknown partner, sex workers or with people who trade sex for money. Corona is a new virus and still studying it. Normal Safety measures followed in sex to protect you, won't be enough for the New Corona. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For instance, A condom is a good option for preventing you from contracting <a href="https://ranamedicalhall.com/health-talks/sexually-transmitted-diseases-gonorrhoea-syphilis-genital-herpes-chlamydia-hpv-warts/">STDs</a> or from unwanted pregnancy.<br>But condom won't be enough for you to save yourself from <a href="https://ranamedicalhall.com/health-talks/unani-and-chronic-virus-infection-management-and-treatment/">COVID 19</a>. Remember, Social distancing and Sex never go hand in hand. So be alert. <strong>Safety should be a Way of life and Safe Sex ensures it.</strong></p>

<p>Social distancing is the new pattern of life, that we all experience in this pandemic time. Actually, during this time we understood or realised the real value or importance of ' touch' in our life. We come to know how these touches affect our physical, mental and emotional well being. Sexual foreplay's is all about touches, cuddling, kisses, hugs, pampering and what not. But for many, foreplay's were of least importance in their sexual life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now during this post Corona period, value all those kisses, hugs, and touches in our life, which was the real building blocks of our emotional well being. Let your lovemaking be filled with too much of <a href="https://ranamedicalhall.com/health-talks/passionate-exploring-adventurous-success-is-yours/">foreplays</a>. This will definitely help you to bring back your emotional balancing and intimacy with your partner and will make your relationship stronger and firmer.</p>

<p>ചെറുപ്പക്കാർ മുതൽ പ്രായമായ ആളുകളെ വരെ, ഒരു പോലെ അലട്ടുന്ന ഒന്നാണ് ലിംഗ വലിപ്പം എന്ന കീറാമുട്ടി.</p>

<h3>എന്തു കൊണ്ട് ഇത്രയേറെ തെറ്റിദ്ധാരണകൾ?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>പരസ്യങ്ങളിലും, മാസികകളിലും, കൂട്ടുകാരിൽ നിന്നും, നീല ചിത്രങ്ങളിൽ നിന്നും, അശ്ലീല വെബ്സൈറ്റുകളിൽ നിന്നും മറ്റും കിട്ടുന്ന തെറ്റായ അറിവും കാഴ്ചകളുമാണ് ഈ തെറ്റിദ്ധാരണകൾക്ക്<br>ആധാരം.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>പുരുഷന്മാർക്ക് മാത്രമല്ല പല സ്ത്രീകൾക്കും തന്റെ പങ്കാളിക്ക് ഉണ്ടാവേണ്ട ലിംഗ വലിപ്പത്തെ കുറിച്ച് വളരെ വലിയ സങ്കല്പം ആണുള്ളത്.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>സുഹൃത്തുക്കളോ, ചിലപ്പോൾ പങ്കാളി തന്നെയോ, അവരുടെ <strong><span class="has-inline-color has-very-dark-gray-color">'വലിപ്പ'</span></strong>ത്തെക്കുറിച്ച് കളിയാക്കുകയോ, പരാതി പറയുകയോ ചെയ്യുന്നതിലൂടെയും ഈ ചിന്ത ആളുകളുടെ മനസ്സിൽ കയറിക്കൂടാം.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ആവശ്യത്തിന് വലിപ്പം ഉണ്ടെങ്കിൽ പോലും, ലൈംഗിക ബന്ധത്തിലെ ചില <a href="https://ranamedicalhall.com/health-talks/which-sex-postures-suits-you-well/">പൊസിഷനുകൾ</a> ശ്രമിക്കുമ്പോൾ, ചിലർക്ക് <a href="https://ranamedicalhall.com/health-talks/does-penis-size-matter-in-sex/">ലിംഗ വലിപ്പം</a> കുറവുള്ളതായി അനുഭവപ്പെടാം. ഇതും പിന്നീട് തെറ്റിദ്ധാരണയ്ക്ക് കാരണമാകാം.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ഈ തെറ്റിദ്ധാരണകളും താരതമ്യങ്ങളും നിങ്ങളെ വളരെ വലിയ വിപത്തിലേക്ക്‌ തള്ളി വിടും. ലിംഗ വലിപ്പം എന്ന ചിന്ത ഒരു ഒഴിയാ ബാധയായി തീർന്നാൽ നിങ്ങൾക്ക് നഷ്ടമാകുന്നത് നിങ്ങളുടെ ആത്മവിശ്വാസമാണ്. പങ്കാളിയുമൊത്തു സന്തോഷകരമായ ഒരു ലൈംഗിക ജീവിതം ആസ്വദിക്കാൻ പറ്റാത്തത്ര മാനസിക പിരിമുറുക്കത്തിലേക്ക് നയിക്കാം. കാലക്രമേണ അത് നിങ്ങളുടെ ലിംഗത്തിന്റെ ഉദ്ധാരണശേഷിയെ വരെ ബാധിക്കും. അതിനാൽ ഇത്തരം ചിന്തകളും തെറ്റിദ്ധാരണകളും മുളയിലെ നുള്ളുക. </p>

<p>സാധാരണ സമയങ്ങളിൽ, ലൈംഗിക ഉത്തേജനം ഇല്ലാത്ത അവസ്ഥയിൽ പുരുഷ ലിംഗം, ഉദ്ധരിക്കാതെ, അയഞ്ഞ അവസ്ഥയിലായിരിക്കും. ഈ സമയത്തെ ലിംഗ വലിപ്പം കിറുകൃത്യമായി നിർണ്ണയിക്കുക ബുദ്ധിമുട്ടാണ്. കാരണം ചില മാനസികാവസ്ഥയിൽ, ഉദാഹരണമായി സങ്കടം ഉള്ള അവസ്ഥ, അല്ലെങ്കിൽ പേടിയോ ടെൻഷൻനോ ഉള്ള സമയത്ത് പുരുഷ ലിംഗം ചുരുങ്ങി സാധാരണയിലും ചെറുതാകുന്ന അവസ്ഥ ഉണ്ടാകാറുണ്ട്. </p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>രതിപൂർവ്വ ലീലകളിൽ സ്ത്രീയും പുരുഷനും ഒരു പോലെ നല്ല മനസ്സോടെ, താൽപര്യത്തോടെ പങ്കെടുക്കുക. എങ്കിൽ മാത്രമേ സ്ത്രീക്കും പുരുഷനും ഒരു പോലെ പൂർണമായ ലൈംഗിക സുഖം ലഭിക്കുകയുള്ളു.</p>

		<Title>Guide to Integrate Sexual Happiness and Satisfaction</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unlike popular belief, there is a great lot of difference between sexual happiness and sexual satisfaction. Sexual happiness can be defined as the byproduct of a great relationship, and sexual satisfaction is a result of a deeper level of intimacy. The major difference between the two is that - it takes only one partner to be sexually satisfied, but sexual happiness is said to happen only where both the partners are satisfied.</p>

<h3>Tips to Integrate</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thus, it is easy to achieve satisfaction in a <a href="https://ranamedicalhall.com/health-talks/need-of-a-successful-sexual-life/">sexual relationship</a>, but it is important that you achieve sexual happiness. Not achieving sexual pleasure or happiness does not always need <strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.roymedicalhall.com/course-duration.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drugs for the weakness of man in bed</a>. </strong>Here are some tips for integrating happiness and satisfaction in your sex life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can say that a couple is sexually happy when they have the capacity to rejuvenate the sexual energy between them effortlessly. Therefore, the term sexual happiness constitutes a very deep meaning. It depicts a couple that can revive and extend the sexual desire they have with each other forever. At the same time, every sexual encounter should be really satisfying for each partner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Factors Behind Merging sexual happiness and satisfaction</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sexual happiness is a result of a strong relationship. Thus, the bonding between both partners is very important to achieve happiness. It is always beyond sexual satisfaction. Being fit is another important thing to achieve sexual happiness. It can help you have better sex, apart from many other reasons. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Besides being more joyful, fit people are capable of producing more sex hormones. You can always take expert advice for women’s and <strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.roymedicalhall.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">men's sexual health and treatment</a>.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moreover, managing your stress levels is very important to integrate happiness and satisfaction. Your reaction to the stressful instances in life can devastate your sexual enthusiasm. Besides, enthusiasm is not in sex, but it is in the individuals. To completely grab the sexual energy, you should be fully present in the moment. For more advice on the topic, you can always consult the <strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.roymedicalhall.com/about-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best doctors for sexual problems</a></strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->]]></Content>
		<Excerpt>As sexual happiness is a result of a strong relationship, one of the most important things is that both the partners should be bonded, to achieve happiness rather than satisfaction.

<p>While talking sex during social distancing, the priority is always safety, as it is of utmost importance at the moment. According to the <strong><a href="https://www.roymedicalhall.com/doctors-behind.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">best sexologist doctors in Kerala</a>, </strong>you will definitely be in a mess if you do not have a steady partner, and your sex life is basically hookups and one night stands.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>How Sex Relieves Stress?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<h3>Should You Go For It?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having said sex is good during this time, there are other factors that you should consider. It will be not so easy for couples to be interested in sex during these times.

		<Title>IS Sex Education Important? What is the Right Age for it?</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Good quality sex education is really important for couples, teenagers, and young adults at present.&nbsp; It will help them make smart decisions regarding sexual health and consent, as the hookup culture is becoming prevalent. Providing them with reliable information to protect themselves and their partners is our responsibility. The happy part is that there are many educational institutions that have made sex education a part of their curriculum to educate students with clear and accurate knowledge. The sad part is that the majority of schools and colleges have not followed suit.</p>

The good thing is that adolescents will gain accurate education on a crucial topic like sexual health.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before talking to children about sex and reproductive health, there are certain things parents should think of. Choosing the right age for it is one of the most important aspects. According to an<strong> <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.roymedicalhall.com/unani.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Unani Sexologist</span></a></strong>, parents should begin sexual education as early as possible. It should ideally start at an age where children begin to embrace new environments. Start with the basics like teaching them the names of all body parts, what is appropriate, and what is not. You should continue it as they grow up.

<h3>The Spooning sex position for couples</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To achieve this position, both the partners have to lay on their sides, facing the same direction. With the man behind, he can then penetrate gently and enjoy slow rocking motions. As this position has only shallow penetration, the man is much likely to last longer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>The Doggy sex position </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the normal doggy position excites the man too easily, there are some modifications that you can try. Start with the normal doggy position, where the woman stands in her hands and knees with her lover in the kneeling position behind her. Then, the woman can slowly lower her body during the penetration and can lay flat in the stomach. This will reduce the amount of stimulation and helps to last longer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>The Cross Position SEX POSITION FOR COUPLES</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This a tricky position, but it’s worth it! The man should lay on his side facing the woman, while she is on her back with legs draped over his pelvis, perpendicular to his body. Once you are comfortable in the position, you can start the play. This position works as the man will have limited motion, which will delay his climax.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>The Sitting Position SEX POSITION </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a position you should try for the slow passion! The <a href="https://ranamedicalhall.com/health-talks/which-sex-postures-suits-you-well/"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">position</span></a> involves the man sitting cross-legged with the woman sitting on the top. The woman will wrap arms and legs around him, to control the intimacy while gently enjoying the penetration. This position can offer a long session as it is slow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If these sex positions for couples are not helping you so much to last longer, you may always go for and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.roymedicalhall.com/ayurveda.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">ayurvedic medicine for Sexual weakness</span></a> that is safe and effective and does not have any side effects.

		<Title>How Diabetes Affects The Sex Life Of Men And Women?</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Diabetes And Its Effect On The Sex Life: Diabetes can impact numerous aspects of your life, including sexual health. When you have diabetes, your body cannot use insulin properly. Thus, it leads to high blood sugar levels. This can lead to several complications like nerve damage and cardiovascular problems. Diabetes can also impact your mental health and self-esteem, which in turn can affect your sexual functions. You would often feel tired, which can further lead to a variety of health concerns.</p>

<h3>Problems in Men</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Diabetes and its effect on the sex life of men: Generally, men with diabetes have reduced testosterone levels, which affects their sex drive. The main sexual problem faced by men with diabetes is erectile dysfunction, the inability to achieve or maintain an erection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Diabetes damages blood vessels, which affect blood flow to the penis, and for a man to achieve an erection, there must be significant blood flow to the penis. Type 2 diabetes often results in obesity, which too can increase the risk of <a href="https://ranamedicalhall.com/health-talks/erection-struggles-are-real/"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">erectile dysfunction</span></a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Problems in Women</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Diabetes and its effect on the sex life of women: Diabetes can impact a woman’s sexual health by damaging the nerves that sense sexual stimulation. High blood sugar levels can cause nerve damage throughout the body, and in women, this could affect the ability to experience sexual pleasure and the release of vaginal lubricant.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These symptoms will result in painful sex and reduced ability to experience orgasm. This could affect her sexual health and can make sex more of an inconvenience than a pleasure. Moreover, diabetic women are more likely to struggle with infections like thrush, cystitis, and also infection of the urinary tract.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>What is Hijama Cupping Therapy?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Hijama Cupping Therapy, the expert therapists put specially designed cups on the patients’ skin to create suction. This therapy has many special benefits including pain relief, minimizing inflammation, improving blood flow, and relaxation. <strong><a href="https://www.roymedicalhall.com/treatments/hijama.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Authentic Hijama Cupping Kerala</span></a> </strong>specializes in addressing sexual disorders.</p>

		<Title>Sex After 50: Everything You Should Know</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is a misconception that older people lose interest in sex. According to studies, people have active sex lives in their later years. Moreover, it has been proved that more than half of the people above the age of 70 are sexually active. At the same time, sex after 50 is not so pleasant because of the physical limitations, lifestyle diseases, menopause, etc. But, these are certainly not so big reasons to halt your lovemaking! Here are the most important things you should know about sex after 50 according to the <strong><a href="https://www.roymedicalhall.com/doctors-behind.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">best sexologist doctors in Kerala</span></a></strong>.</p>

<h3>It’s Good For You</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sex has many benefits for your health. According to experts, staying sexually active in older ages is not only good for your physical health but it’s also good for your mental health. Sex boosts mood and lowers stress besides increasing your emotional connection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Certain Positions Are Safer</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sex is physically demanding, and your favorite moves may put stress on your body after 50. Thus, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/rFbavnxWP6B9bhAj7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">sexologist</span></a>s suggest positions that utilize larger muscle groups, like spooning, missionary, and doggie style. Basically, you ought to acknowledge your limitations and take things slow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Softer Sex after 50</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, we are talking about the penis. It is natural not to have the strongest erections after a certain age. But it doesn’t mean that the man is not feeling the desire. Moreover, you could have<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.roymedicalhall.com/treatments/nocturnal-emissions.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color"><strong>nocturnal emissions </strong>or <strong>Nightfalls</strong></span></a>. You can take the help of <strong><a href="https://www.roymedicalhall.com/ayurveda.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Ayurvedic medicine for sexual weakness</span></a> </strong>for better sex after 50. Also, you could go for an <strong><a href="https://www.roymedicalhall.com/treatments/penile-enhancement.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">effective penile enhancement treatment</span></a> </strong>that will help you get back the lost strength.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>More Sexual Freedom (sex after 50)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just like wine, sex gets better with age! While you grow older, you can settle into your body without fears and inhibitions. According to sexologists, women are often concerned with sexual performance in their youth. But after the 50s, they understand more about their bodies, and the sex becomes great!</p>
